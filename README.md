# rock-paper-scissors

This is a minimal grade school classic rock, paper and scissors game. Have fun!

## What I learned
 - Importance of writing simple functions, each doing their core task as oppossed to having chunky, difficult-to-read functions
 - Spending an hour writing pseudocode saves four hours of writing code
 - Importance of committing early and often
 - Git is an art of its own to be mastered separately
